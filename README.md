# LiSi Project
 
1. Preprocessing: 

   convert the xsf file to the data file.
   
2. Construction of models:

   (0) generate Coarse Graning (CG) particles through LAMMPS;
   
   (1) replicate in 3 dimensions from a unit cell;
   
   (2) cut spheres/nanoparticles from replicated structures;
   
   (3) replace different-sized CG particles with different all-atom nanoparticles.
3. Visualization:

   (1) monitor the training of ML potential;

   (2) visualize the distribution of dataset.
