# LiSi Project
 
1. Preprocessing: convert the xsf file to the data file.
2. Model Constructing: (0) generate Coarse Graning (CG) particles through LAMMPS; (1) replicate in 3 dimensions from a unit cell; (2) cut spheres/nanoparticles from replicated structures; (3) replace different-sized CG particles with different all-atom nanoparticles.
